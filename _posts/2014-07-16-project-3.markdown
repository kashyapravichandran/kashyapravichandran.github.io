description: The working of a superscalar processor was simulated using two similar but different architecture. One, using a Reorder Buffer and another using a Physical Register file and an active list with a free list. The IPC of the simulation was studied when perfect cache and perfect branch prediction were turned off. <br> The github repositories for these projects are linked here: [a OoO with Reorder Buffer](https://github.com/kashyapravichandran/dynamic-instruction-scheduling), [a OoO with active list and a physical register file](https://github.com/kashyapravichandran/ECE721-sim).
