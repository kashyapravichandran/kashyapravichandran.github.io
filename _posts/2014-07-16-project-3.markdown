description: A memory heirarchy with L1 and L2 caches. The L1 cache can be a n-way set associative cache or a direct mapped decoupled sectored cache. L2 can be either be a direct mapped cache or a n-way set associative cache. The effect of cache size, block size and associativity on the miss rate and the average access time was studied. <br> The second simulation considers 'n' differnt processor cores each with their own private L1 cache and MSI, MESI and Dragon coherence protocols were applied to simulate the workings of a simultaneous multiprocessor system. The effect these protocols have on cache to cache transfers and miss rate were studied.
