description: The working of a superscalar processor was simulated using two similar but different architecture. One, using a Reorder Buffer and another using a Physical Register file and an active list with a free list. The IPC of the simulation was studied when perfect cache and perfect branch prediction were turned off. The github repositories for these projects are linked here: <a href="https://github.com/kashyapravichandran/dynamic-instruction-scheduling">OoO with Reorder Buffer</a>,<a href="https://github.com/kashyapravichandran/ECE721-sim"> OoO with active list and a physical register file </a>
