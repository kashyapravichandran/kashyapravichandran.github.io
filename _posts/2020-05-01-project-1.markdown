description: In a modern superscalar processor control dependence seems to be the biggest bottleneck for any type of
increase in IPC as it limits the number of useful instructions that are fetched and executed. This
architecture tries to explore the domain of control independent region execution and hopes to reduce the
number of useless instructions that are fetched by the processor. The skipper architecture skips over the
control dependent region, saves its progress, and goes ahead to execute data-independent control
independent instructions till the branch resolves, and once it is resolved the processor switches context to
the skipped region to execute instructions from that skipped region.
